Goal of the thesis: Provide a taxonomy of entities in the network of ERC20 tokens
- Generally only the addresses and their transfers are known
- Only few labels exist on Etherscan
-> Address has to be categorized/grouped based on the subgraph around it
- A high number of all transfers >83% involve an entity which transfered to over 100 other addresses
- 90% of addresses interacted with an address with degree over 100
- Those addresses with a degree > 100 can be neatly grouped into three categories based on whether they rather emit or receive tokens.
-> clustering and understanding these addresses leads to better understanding of the whole network

Chapter 1: Understanding High Degree Nodes
- Annectotically Token Networks are dominated by ICOs/Airdrops and Exchanges
- I try to identify ICOs/Airdrops and Exchanges by ERC20 Tokens

## Exchanges
1. Exchanges need to determine who deposited money, either use smart contracts or deposit addresses for that. Usually the latter. I focus on the latter in this work.
1. I propose a model for exchanges
2. It is generally possible to find deposit addresses and receiving addresses, with showing it
3. Determining which sender addresses belong to which receiver address is in general hard (show that)
3a. Maybe heatmap showing how different high degree nodes interacted with receiver addresses
4. Show two examples exchanges

## ICOs/Airdrops
1. Explain that transfers before ICOs, multiple ICOs are common.

## Results
Show how many high degree nodes can be labeled as Exchange/ICO/Airdrop

Chapter 2: Deducing Ownership from Token Networks
1. An entity can use multiple addresses, for an entity taxonomy it is helpful to understand which addresses belong to the same entity
2. I propose three? heuristics and evaluate their usefulness
- Deposit addresses belong to their receiver
- Deposit address couse
- Paper wallet use
- Mapping sender and receiver addresses based Exchanges 3a
3. Evaluate the heuristcs: How many addresses/value owned do they group? Can we find definite false positives?
4. Analysis of the ownership graph

Chapter 3: Taxonomy of Token Entities

Chapter 4: K-Anonymity in the ERC20 Token Network

Chapter 4: Case Study: Usage in different token networks? BAT? Aragon?

Chapter 5: Relationship between token entities and their network?

chapter 6: Architecture ?


Was ich so gemacht habe:
1. Exchanges weiter modelliert: 
	1. Ich kann receiver finden, 
	2. receiver zu sendern zuordnen ist schwer
	3. Wohl nur möglich zu sagen "they have a business relationship", but not "they belong to the same entity"
	4. Methode diskutieren
2. Looked into ICOs
	1. Tokens do not start with an ICO
	2. Pre ICO transfers are common
	3. Multiple ICOs/Airdrops are common
	4. ICOs/Airdrops occur while other tokens are traded
	5. Propose way of detecting them/definition
	6. I shreded my dataset and cant use that now
	7. Proposed Definition/
3. High Degree nodes
	1. high degree nodes can be clustered into three groups
	2. 85% of transfers involve either a node with a distinct degree of over 100 or a deposit address. 90% of addresses interact with one
4. Basis outline für meine Arbeit
	Kapitel/Story
	Soll da auch die Architektur rein?
5. Weitere Spannende Richtung: K-Anonymity - How many entities actually hold the same tokens and use the same exchanges?
6. Tokenexplore

Fragen:
1. Wie zeige ich dass meine Deposit Accounts/Receiver Accounts stimmig sind?
2. Bürokratie: Wie gehts denn der Anmeldung?
3. Terminologie: Degree == Anzahl der Kanten oder Anzahl der Knoten zu denen die Kanten führen?
